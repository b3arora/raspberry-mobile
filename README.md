# raspberry-mobile
a hardware project made for the cool as hack youth hacks event by @bahaar and @layan on slack, along with 2 other members who are not on slack/affiliated with hack club

this project involved a robotic car made using a raspberry pi and a remote controller which was also made using raspberry pi, which connected to the car using the ip address
this car was the first hardware project i have made, and therefore was created by following a raspberry pi tutorial

challenges i faced included making the motors run as expected, which did not happen as the motor controllers were faulty.
the remote controller also did not function as planned in the first try, which had to be fixed by connecting the monitors programming the pi's to a personal hotspot network and using the new ip addresses.
